# Finding-Lanes
This is one of my self driving cars practice projects written with python and openCV.
It is just a very basic project which finds the lane lines in a given road image, draws a green line over the detected lane lines,
and stores the lane coordinates in a list.
I included output images processed at the different stages of the project in the "output-images" folder included on this repo

THIS IS JUST A VERY BASIC PROGRAM, BEWARE!
